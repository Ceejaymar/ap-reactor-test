Notes:

Overall took about 8-10 hours

Got stumped a few times because I was working with some things I haven't much experience with, ie: React router 4, but I wanted to learn it.
I did not have to use SASS but I want ot get better with it and it's nicer for organizing CSS. The variables come in very handy. I decided to use CSS variables and not SASS variables, incase I needed to do some math with the variables. I then realized CSS variables don't translate well to RGB, where SASS does. SASS variables would have worked better for me in this case. Now I know!

With more time, I would've not used the built-in browser alert for subscribe. The built-in alerts stop the app completely, which is not a desirable effect. I would've tried to make a custom alert or use a package, which I'm sure exists. Albeit, using the default alert was fine in my case. I also would have made the sign up and pages more dynamic. Instead of having two similar components, I could have one and adjust the information accordingly.

The requirements were clear and easy to follow. I really liked the included style guide in the design pdf. Overall, it was fun working on this code challenge. I may just comtinue working on it to implement what I mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Thank you for the opportunity!
